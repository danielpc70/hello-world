# hello-world

Hello!

You can call me PatC. I am learning all I need to know about GitHub.
My recent attempt to update this file.

I love :coffee:, :dancer:, and :cd:.
I love to eat food from :haiti:, :jamaica:, :greece:, and :thailand:.

I enjoy listening to music, dancing, singing (although I am not
that great of singer), reading mostly fictional books, binge watching 
documentaries and comedies, and riding my bike.
